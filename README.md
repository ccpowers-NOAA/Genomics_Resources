This is a shared repository to facilitate gathering resources useful for ongoing genomics work at across NMFS. 

Initial plans are to:

- [Omics tutorials](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/Genomics_Resources/tree/main/tutorials)
    - Gather and link to existing tutorials and code relevant to lcWGS, gt-seq, etc.
    - Write short tutorials for running various scripts that would broadly useful across many analyses (fastqc, trimming, bwa mem, etc).
    - Develop specific tutorials for topics specific to various groups 

- Gather and post code broadly useful to multiple groups

- How to make code and data reproducible and open?
  - Submitting raw data to NCBI
  - Submitting data/results to zenodo (or what is recommended by NMFS?)
  - Github releases and linking to zenodo for publications

**These plans are very preliminary and open to change and suggestion**
