This pipeline processes BAM files to generate alignment statistics including:
- Total reads
- Mapped reads and percentage
- Duplicate reads and percentage
- High-quality mapped reads (Q20) and percentage


## To run

Assuming you're using sedna, to run, start a new screen or tmux (very important). Then run the command below:


```bash

mamba activate nextflow-24.04.4

nextflow run bam_stats.nf \
    -profile count_bams \
    --input_dir path/to/your/bam/files \
    --output_dir path/to/output \
    --output_file counts.csv

```

where:
- `count_bams.nf` is the nextflow script that runs the alignment stats.  
- ` --input_dir` is the path to your bam files
- `--output_dir` is the output location for the txt file
- `output_file` is the name of the output file, which will be csv

The pipeline generates a CSV file with the following columns:

- sample: Sample name derived from BAM filename
- total_reads: Total number of reads
- total_mapped: Number of mapped reads
- map_percent: Percentage of mapped reads
- duplicates: Number of duplicate reads
- dup_percent: Percentage of duplicate reads
- mapped_q20: Number of mapped reads with mapping quality â‰¥20
- map_percent_q20: Percentage of Q20 mapped reads


## nf tower

If you want, you can track your run with nextflow tower. To do this, make an account on [seqera](https://cloud.seqera.io/). Then generate an access token ([instructions here](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/23.1/getting-started/usage)). Add this token to the `nextflow.config` file on line 4. 

Then you can run your job with the same command as above, but adding `-with-tower`. For example:

```bash
mamba activate nextflow-24.04.4

nextflow run bam_stats.nf \
    -profile count_bams \
    --input_dir path/to/your/bam/files \
    --output_dir path/to/output \
    --output_file counts.csv \
    -with-tower

```

And you can monitor it at https://tower.nf/ under `runs`.
